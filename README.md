OBSERVATIONS
Certain teams account for a significantly larger proportion of the workforce, indicating their critical role in the company’s operations.
Smaller teams may suggest specialized or niche areas of expertise.
EMPLOYEE POSITIONS
Predominantly, employees are concentrated in a few key roles, reflecting the company’s focus areas.
Less frequent positions could indicate higher specialization or more senior roles.
AGE GROUP TRENDS
The majority of employees fall within a specific age range, suggesting targeted hiring practices or workforce demographics.
If younger age groups dominate, it could indicate a growing and dynamic workforce, whereas older age groups might reflect experience and stability
SALARY EXPENDITURE
Teams and positions with the highest salary expenditure are likely pivotal to the company’s success, possibly reflecting roles with greater responsibilities or specialized skills.
Disparities between teams might highlight differences in priorities or resource allocation
AGE VS SALARY CORRELATION
A positive correlation might indicate that salary grows with experience and tenure
If the correlation is weak, it could suggest standardized pay scales or non-traditional compensation structures.

Analysis Process: The dataset was explored by preprocessing inconsistent values, such as replacing the "height" column with random integers in the range of 150–180 for uniformity. Key analysis steps included determining employee distribution across teams and positions, identifying predominant age groups, assessing salary expenditures, and analyzing correlations
